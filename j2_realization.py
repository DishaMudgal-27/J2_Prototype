"""Realization axis for Adaptation (agents/j2/realization.md, docs/realization-axis.md): plan, check, judge, revise.

plan_goal(goal) runs the planning half on its own, outside J2's loop. Nothing is built here.
1. Adaptation proposes factors, stages and workflows (realization.md + certainty.md).
2. Code checks the rules (plan_faults); a plan with faults is sent back once with the faults named.
3. A separate judge call answers a yes/no checklist about every workflow (confidence-judge.md): fixed questions under six
   checks, item questions written once per charter, and one per owned factor. Code computes each score from the
   answers and rolls scores up: a stage is its weakest workflow, the plan its weakest stage. A revision the judge
   calls no better can't score higher; near the gate the judge looks twice and the lower result counts.
4. Below 0.80, Adaptation revises for the weakest check and the judge scores again, up to three rounds.
5. Whatever is still below 0.80 is not_ready and not funded; workflows behind it, and behind a blocking Requester fact,
   are held.
The returned record (and trace.json / report.md when out_dir is given) keeps every round.
